# Work flow
Step 1:
Find out the top 10 critical <Noun> and its <Category> by a given <Industry>. 

Step 2:
To use each <Noun> to to the analysis. The analysis includes:
# Brief Industry Overview
# Social Value: Identifying the positive value generated for society and customers, rather than negative value. This is the fundamental starting point of value investing.
Industry Chain Summary
# Core Links and Technology
# Entry Barrier Analysis
# Next-Gen Product Analysis
# Existing Competitive Landscape Analysis
# Technological Breakthroughs: For instance, over recent years, the most significant development in the consumer internet industry was the implementation of algorithms. Processing power can be purchased through servers and CPUs, but algorithms require a team of mathematicians and computer scientists. China's algorithm capabilities are not lacking, being reasonably comparable to the U.S. The most fruitful commercial use of advanced algorithms is in the internet sector, followed by AI, or more specifically, AI was initially used in algorithm-based recommendations, traffic operations, product recommendations - much of this logic, or even the commercialization of data relating to relationships between platforms and people, was driven by algorithms. Technological breakthroughs are very important, and commercial application of algorithm technology constitutes a significant aspect.
# Process Breakthroughs: Breakthroughs in this aspect tend to be closer to manufacturing industries, such as the mechanical fields, chemical industries and other midstream manufacturing sectors.
# Business Model Innovation
# The third type is innovation in business models and organizational models, seen in the consumer internet, consumer goods and services sector.
